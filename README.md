# Travel agency digital service
This is one my data projects for HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp (full portfolio available [here](https://www.hyperiondev.com/portfolio/IF23120013127)).

This program simulates a Travel agency digital service which allows users who want to go on holiday to look for a round trip flight that suits their needs.

It takes the data from an external .csv file (Flights_info.csv) and manipulate them using Pandas library in order to retrieve the information requested from the users.

Users are asked to compose a round trip selecting their preferred flights among the available ones corresponding to their selected departure city, arrival city and departure date. Users also need to select additional services, such as extra luggage, car rental or travel insurance.

In the end, after collecting all the users' choices, the program shows the trip summary with all the details, the single price of every flight and service and the total cost of the trip.

The program makes use of:
- Python programming language
- while/for loops
- conditional statements
- user-defined functions
- Pandas library
- data manipulation
